# Operations Phase — Main Orchestrator

## Purpose

The OPERATIONS phase takes an application from CONSTRUCTION (working code + tests) through progressive deployment to production. It enforces hard progression gates (no skipping), is technology-agnostic, and follows the same patterns as INCEPTION and CONSTRUCTION.

## Design Principles

1. **Progressive validation**: Each stage must fully pass before the next begins. No skipping.
2. **Match the target**: Stage 2 simulation MUST match the actual target environment.
3. **Technology agnostic**: Defines principles, stages, and gates — not specific commands.
4. **Fault isolation**: If something fails, you know EXACTLY which stage it failed at and why.
5. **Everything progresses**: Code, build scripts, deploy scripts, seed data, config, IaC — ALL go through all stages.
6. **Safe by default**: Tests never touch production data. Security groups never open to 0.0.0.0/0.
7. **Exhaust automated before manual**: ALL automated steps completed before requesting manual Console actions.
8. **First-try success**: Scripts proven at Stage 2 should succeed first-try on cloud (Stage 3+).

## Stage Execution Rules

### Stage 0: Prerequisites & Test Development (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

**Purpose**: Ensure the application has an automated test suite, organized structure, and defined seed data strategy before any deployment work begins.

**Execution**:
1. Load all steps from `operations/prerequisites-test-development.md`
2. Auto-discover project state (scan for tests, structure, DB, Dockerfile, CI/CD)
3. Present findings for user validation
4. If gaps found (no tests, no structure): develop them
5. **Gate**: Automated test suite passes 100%, structure documented
6. **Wait for Explicit Approval** — DO NOT PROCEED until user confirms

### Stage 1: Environment Strategy (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

**Purpose**: Define deployment targets, environments, branch strategy, DB rollout, config strategy, rollback approach, automation level.

**Execution**:
1. Load all steps from `operations/environment-strategy.md`
2. Ask ALL 9 environment strategy questions — none may be skipped or auto-answered silently
3. If user says "use best judgement": make choices, but STATE them visibly and give user opportunity to override
4. Document answers in `aidlc-docs/operations/environment-strategy.md`
5. Generate deployment plan based on answers (must address DB rollout, config strategy, and rollback)
6. **MANDATORY**: If ALL cloud stages (4-7) would be skipped, present degenerate result safeguard confirmation
7. **Wait for Explicit Approval** — DO NOT PROCEED until user confirms

### Stage 2: Local Scripts & Validation (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

**Purpose**: Create build/test/run/deploy scripts and validate everything works locally.

**Execution**:
1. Load all steps from `operations/local-scripts-validation.md`
2. Auto-discover existing scripts (scan project for build.sh, test.sh, deploy/, Dockerfile, etc.)
3. Present findings for validation ("I found these scripts, are they the ones to use?")
4. Gap analysis: identify missing scripts vs. deployment plan requirements
5. Create missing scripts OR validate existing ones
6. Run ALL scripts locally — every one must pass
7. Run FULL test suite locally (all tests, not a subset)
8. **Gate**: All scripts pass, full test suite passes, health check responds
9. **Wait for Explicit Approval** — DO NOT PROCEED until user confirms

### Stage 3: Staging Simulation Locally (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

**Purpose**: Simulate the real deployment architecture locally, matching the actual target.

**Execution**:
1. Load all steps from `operations/staging-simulation.md`
2. Determine simulation requirements per target (see matching rules)
3. Set up local simulation environment
4. Run deploy scripts on matching environment
5. Run FULL E2E test suite against local simulation
6. **Gate**: All deploy scripts pass first-try, full E2E passes
7. **Wait for Explicit Approval** — DO NOT PROCEED until user confirms

**Matching Rules**:
| Deployment Target | Stage 3 Simulation | NOT This |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| ECS (container) | Docker container locally | — |
| EC2 on-prem (bare metal) | Run on matching local machine (same OS) | ❌ Docker |
| RDS SQL Server | SQL Server container locally | ❌ SQLite |
| Lambda | Local invoke (SAM) | ❌ Docker |
| Amplify | Run amplify.yml commands locally | — |

### Stage 4: Staging Cloud Deployment (ALWAYS EXECUTE)

**Purpose**: Deploy to actual cloud infrastructure and validate with full E2E.

**Execution**:
1. Load all steps from `operations/staging-deployment.md`
2. Deploy IaC (CDK/CloudFormation/Terraform)
3. Deploy application to cloud target
4. Verify health check on cloud endpoint
5. Run FULL E2E test suite against cloud endpoint
6. **Gate**: First-try deployment success, full E2E passes against cloud
7. **Wait for Explicit Approval** — DO NOT PROCEED until user confirms

**Critical Rule**: If deployment fails at Stage 4, STOP. Fix locally at Stage 3 first. Then redeploy. Do NOT iterate on cloud.

### Stage 5: CI/CD Pipeline (CONDITIONAL)

**Execute IF**: Automation level requires push-to-deploy pipeline.
**Skip IF**: Manual deployment with scripts is sufficient.

**Execution**:
1. Load all steps from `operations/ci-cd-pipeline.md`
2. Create/validate pipeline configuration (CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, etc.)
3. Deploy pipeline infrastructure
4. Test pipeline trigger (push to branch → pipeline executes → deploys)
5. Verify pipeline produces same result as manual deployment
6. **Gate**: Push triggers pipeline, pipeline deploys successfully, E2E passes
7. **Wait for Explicit Approval** — DO NOT PROCEED until user confirms

### Stage 6: Multi-Environment (CONDITIONAL)

**Execute IF**: Multiple environments needed (staging + UAT + production).
**Skip IF**: Single environment is sufficient.

**Execution**:
1. Load all steps from `operations/multi-environment.md`
2. Deploy additional environments (UAT, production)
3. Verify branch→environment mapping
4. Test approval gates between environments
5. Run FULL E2E per environment
6. Verify environment isolation
7. **Gate**: Each environment independently passes E2E, isolation confirmed
8. **Wait for Explicit Approval** — DO NOT PROCEED until user confirms

### Stage 7: Operational Readiness (CONDITIONAL)

**Execute IF**: Production deployment requires monitoring, alerting, runbooks.
**Skip IF**: Not going to production yet, or ops readiness not required.

**Execution**:
1. Load all steps from `operations/operational-readiness.md`
2. Set up monitoring and alerting
3. Create runbooks for common operations
4. Document rollback procedures
5. Create incident response plan
6. **Gate**: Monitoring active, runbooks documented, rollback tested
7. **Wait for Explicit Approval** — DO NOT PROCEED until user confirms

## Hard Gate Rules

1. Stage N **MUST** pass before Stage N+1 can begin
2. If a script/artifact is MODIFIED, re-validate from the earliest affected stage
3. The AI **REFUSES** to deploy to a higher stage if the current stage hasn't passed
4. **Opt-out**: User can explicitly say "skip gate X" — logged in audit.md with acknowledgment
5. **ALL unblocked automated steps** executed before presenting manual steps
6. **First-try success required** at Stage 4+: Scripts proven at Stage 3 should succeed first-try
7. **"Eventually worked" ≠ validated**: Multi-retry success means fix locally and redo

---

## MANDATORY: Security Constraints (Non-Negotiable, Independent of Extensions)

These rules apply to ALL operations regardless of whether the Security Baseline extension is enabled. They are hard-coded into the Operations phase and cannot be opted out of.

**Rule S1: NEVER open 0.0.0.0/0 on any port**
```
The AI MUST NEVER execute any command that adds an inbound security group rule
with source 0.0.0.0/0 (or ::/0) on ANY port. This includes:
- aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
- CDK/Terraform/CloudFormation resources with 0.0.0.0/0 ingress
- Any equivalent across any cloud provider

NO EXCEPTIONS. NO JUSTIFICATIONS ACCEPTED. Not even:
- "It's just a game / demo / test"
- "No sensitive data"
- "It's temporary"
- "GitHub Actions needs access" (use dynamic IP whitelisting instead)
- "It's only port 80/443"
- "It's a public-facing load balancer" (use WAF + restricted origin)

If the AI encounters a scenario where it THINKS 0.0.0.0/0 is needed:
1. STOP — do NOT execute the command
2. Present the scenario to the user
3. Propose a RESTRICTED alternative (specific IP, CIDR range, or dynamic SG management)
4. Wait for explicit user approval of the alternative
5. Log in audit.md that 0.0.0.0/0 was considered and rejected

The word "NEVER" means NEVER. There is no condition under which this is acceptable.
```

**Rule S2: Restrict all access to deployer IP or VPN CIDR**
```
All security group ingress rules MUST specify a restricted source:
- Deployer's current IP (/32)
- Corporate VPN CIDR
- Another security group reference
NEVER 0.0.0.0/0.
```

**Rule S3: Test data isolation**
```
Tests MUST NEVER touch production data at any stage.
- Isolated test databases (separate DB name or separate instance)
- Test teardown cleans up test data
- No shared state between test runs and production
```

**Rule S4: No secrets in code or logs**
```
- No passwords, API keys, or connection strings in source code
- No secrets in command-line arguments (visible in process list)
- Use secrets manager / parameter store / env vars
- Logs must not contain secret values
```

**Enforcement**: Before executing ANY `aws` CLI command that modifies security groups, network ACLs, or firewall rules, the AI MUST:
1. Check that no `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0` appears in the command
2. Verify the CIDR is a specific IP or restricted range
3. If the command would open unrestricted access: REFUSE and explain why
4. Log the refusal in audit.md

---

## MANDATORY: Cascading Skip Prevention

**Problem**: A single upstream decision (e.g., "no cloud deployment" in Stage 1) can cause ALL subsequent cloud stages (4-7) to be skipped, reducing the entire Operations phase to trivial local validation. This defeats the purpose of the phase.

**Rules to prevent cascading skips**:

1. **Minimum Operations Bar**: The Operations phase MUST result in at least ONE deployment beyond localhost, unless the user EXPLICITLY confirms local-only deployment. "Use best judgement" is NOT explicit confirmation.

2. **Stage Skip Audit**: When any stage is marked SKIP, the AI must log:
   - WHICH stage is being skipped
   - WHY it's being skipped (trace back to which answer/decision caused it)
   - Whether the skip was EXPLICITLY requested by the user or INFERRED by the AI
   - If inferred: present for confirmation

3. **Auto-Answer Scope Limit**: When the user says "use best judgement" or similar, the AI may auto-answer questions about HOW to deploy (branch strategy, DB engine, automation level) but must NOT auto-answer WHETHER to deploy to cloud. Cloud vs. local-only is a scope decision that requires explicit user input OR strong environmental evidence (see environment-strategy.md context-awareness rules).

4. **Recovery Path**: If the Operations phase ends with only Stage 2-3 completed and the user later asks "why wasn't this deployed?", the AI must:
   - Acknowledge the gap
   - Identify which Stage 1 answer caused the cascade
   - Offer to re-run from Stage 1 with updated answers
   - Follow Rule 2 (never skip stages) when re-running

## Parallel Deployment Paths

When multiple targets exist, each has its OWN independent progression:

```
ECS Path:     Stage 2 → Stage 3 (Docker) → Stage 4 (ECR→ECS→ALB) → Stage 5/6
On-Prem Path: Stage 2 → Stage 3 (matching machine) → Stage 4 (CodeDeploy→EC2) → Stage 5/6
```

Passing one path does NOT validate the other. Both must independently pass all stages.

---

## State Tracking

Update `aidlc-state.md` with operations progress using this format:

```markdown
### OPERATIONS PHASE
- [x] Stage 0: Prerequisites (test suite: X tests pass, structure documented)
- [x] Stage 1: Environment Strategy (answers documented)
- [x] Stage 2: Local Scripts (all pass, E2E: X tests)
- [ ] Stage 3: Staging Simulation
  - [x] ECS path: Docker container, E2E passes
  - [ ] On-Prem path: Matching machine, E2E passes
- [ ] Stage 4: Cloud Deployment
  - [ ] ECS path: ALB responds, E2E passes
  - [ ] On-Prem path: CodeDeploy succeeds, E2E passes
- [ ] Stage 5: CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Stage 6: Multi-Environment
- [ ] Stage 7: Operational Readiness
```

---

## Completion Message Format

After each stage completes, present:

```markdown
## Stage X: [Name] — COMPLETE ✅

**Evidence**:
- [List what was validated with specific numbers/outputs]

**Gate Status**: PASSED
- [Criteria met with evidence]

**Next Stage**: Stage X+1: [Name]

Choose:
1. **Request Changes** — specify what needs modification
2. **Continue to Stage X+1** — proceed to next stage
```
